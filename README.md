Liberty BASIC (LB) is a commercial programming language and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created and maintained by Carl Gundel of Shoptalk Systems. It was first released in 1992 and has progressed and evolved to it's current version at a thoughtful and mature pace ever since. The most recent update, version 4.5.1, was released June 2018.

Current development is focused on version 5.0 for a new cross-platform compatible implementation to provide portable source code functionality for PC, Mac, Linux and the Raspberry Pi. The most recent update, version 5.0-alpha build 350, was released August 10, 2019.

Throughout the years, since its initial release, there have been several projects dedicated to document the versatile functionality of this language with published books, newsletters, wikis, and independent web sites. Many have faultered along the way, but attempts at preserving their content have been achieved when possible.

In an effort to serve as a single, central repository of information, this Vault was created to maintain the archives of these previous projects. 

It also serves as a continuing effort to document new releases and updates of the language and IDE, as well as produce new, and hopefully engaging, informational materials.

In Short, The Liberty BASIC Vault hopes to be *the* go-to place for additjonal information on Liberty BASIC to supplement the product web site at libertybasic.com.
